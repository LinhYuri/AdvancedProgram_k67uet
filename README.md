The game was developed based on the classic Flappy Bird game but has been augmented with additional features, graphics and sounds to make it more lively.

The game is written in C++ using the SDL2.0 graphics library and programmed on Visual Studio Code.


## ***Programming language and Technology***
- Language: C++
- Graphics library SDL2.0
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (or any another IDE that supports C++)

## ***Setting***
- Step 1: Download the game source code from the official GitHub repository.
- Step 2: Unzip the ZIP file.
- Step 3: Locate the main.exe file and open it to start playing the game.

If your screen displays the message ***Windows protected your PC***, please click on ***More info*** and then click on ***Run anyway***. 


## ***Description***
***Let's assume you are living in a world without the Flappy Bird game :))***

### ***Start Screen***
Players will start the game with three options: ***start***, ***quit*** or ***how to play*** (to view game instructions).

### ***Gameplay***
- The game has been improved from the previous version, with columns that move unexpectedly and you cannot predict it beforehand. Players use the `SPACE` key or the `UP` key or ***click the mouse*** to control the bird to fly over the columns on the flight path. Your mission is to control the bird to avoid colliding with the columns or the game screen and collect points. When the bird flies over a column, you will get 1 point added.


- You can pause the game while playing by pressing the `Esc` key, where you have options: adjust the sound, ***resume***, ***restart*** or ***quit***.
